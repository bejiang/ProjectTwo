        <p>
            Little hands holding onto dear life and each other
            Trusting that in sickness and health
            No matter what happens, for whatever may come
            “We will face all our fortune and pain as one.”
            <br>
            
            Pressing onwards alongside your trusted friends, helping one another
            Then the fear that you feel will all come to an end
            <br>    
            
            Did you think that we would let you go on all alone?
            No matter what happens, for whatever may come,
            “We will face all our fortunes and pain as one!”
        </p>
