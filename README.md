# project overview
The project is to create an interactive experience using text from a work that represents what community means for me.

I used the song "Blessed Mesiah and the Tower of Ai", by ひとしずくP  (Hitoshizuku P). I chose this as the base text for my project because this song represents what community means for me. There are 10 singers, supporting the idea of facing hardships together no matter what happens. Community for me is about helping each other, sharing the good and bad parts alike, because life isn’t as scary when you’re going together.
